# 👥 STAFF GUIDE: Individual Order Billing

**How to handle separate customers at the same table**

---

## 🎯 The Problem We Solved

**Before**: When multiple customers ordered separately at Table 1, the system would show one big bill for NPR 3,300 (all orders combined). This meant you couldn't give individual customers their specific bills.

**Now**: You can bill each customer separately for exactly what they ordered!

## 📱 How to Use Individual Billing

### Step 1: Access Billing Page
1. Go to **Billing & Transactions** in your app
2. You'll see two options at the top:
   - **Individual Orders** ← Use this! (Default)
   - **Consolidated Tables** ← Old method

### Step 2: Find the Table with Multiple Orders
Look for tables that show multiple order cards like this:

```
📋 Table 1                                    [2 orders]
   
   Order #94a72c1c                           [View] [Pay]
   John Doe • 2:30 PM
   NPR 1,050

   Order #37c73b65                           [View] [Pay] 
   Jane Smith • 3:15 PM
   NPR 600
```

### Step 3: Process Individual Payments

**For each customer:**
1. **Click "View"** to see what they ordered
2. **Click "Pay"** to process their payment
3. **Choose payment method** (Cash/Card/Online/QR)
4. **Click "Complete Payment"**

**Result**: That specific customer's order disappears from the billing list!

## 🧾 Customer Interaction Guide

### When Customer Asks: *"Why does my bill show multiple items?"*

**Old Problem**: Bill showed items from other customers too

**New Solution**: Each customer only sees their own items on the bill

### When Customer Says: *"I only ordered one item, not four!"*

**What to do**:
1. Show them the **Individual Orders** view
2. Point to their specific order card
3. Process payment for their order only
4. Their receipt will show only their items

### 👥 **Individual Orders Mode** (Default)
**Use when**: 
- Different customers throughout the day
- People want separate bills
- Customers paying individually

**Example**: Lunch rush with different customers at same table

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "I don't see individual orders"
**Solution**: Click the "Individual Orders" button at the top of the billing page

### Problem: "Customer complains about wrong bill amount"  
**Solution**: 
1. Switch to Individual Orders view
2. Show them their specific order card
3. Process payment for that order only

### Problem: "Table won't clear after payment"
**Solution**: This is normal! Table stays occupied until ALL orders are paid. Once the last order is paid, table becomes available.
