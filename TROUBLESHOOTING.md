# OrderChha Client-Side Error Resolution

## Problem Identified

Your OrderChha application was experiencing client-side errors across multiple pages, showing "Application error: a client-side exception has occurred" messages. After analyzing the code, we identified several issues:

1. **Environment Variable Handling**: Improper handling of environment variables causing connection failures to both Appwrite and Supabase services.
2. **Error Handling**: Missing proper error boundaries and fallbacks when services are unavailable.
3. **Authentication Flow**: Issues in the authentication layer were causing page loads to fail.
4. **Context Provider Issues**: The application context was not properly handling initialization failures.
5. **TypeScript Errors**: Multiple TypeScript errors in the Supabase client implementation causing compilation issues, including:
   - Missing type definitions for PostgrestFilterBuilder methods
   - Type errors with realtime subscription methods
   - Incorrect implementation of mock objects for error handling

## Solutions Implemented

We've made several improvements to fix these issues:

### 1. Added Error Boundaries

We created a robust error boundary component (`ErrorBoundary`) that catches runtime errors and provides a user-friendly fallback UI instead of the default error page.

### 2. Added Client-Side Diagnostics

Created a comprehensive debug page at `/debug` that:
- Tests connections to both Supabase and Appwrite
- Displays environment variable status
- Provides detailed error information
- Suggests potential fixes

### 3. Improved Environment Variable Handling

Updated the Supabase client initialization to include fallback values and better error handling when variables are missing or invalid.

### 4. Added API Routes for Diagnostics

Created API routes to safely test connections to backend services:
- `/api/debug/check-supabase`
- `/api/debug/check-appwrite`

### 5. Enhanced Auth Layout

Improved the `AuthLayout` component to detect loading timeouts and provide a better user experience when services are slow or unavailable.

### 6. Added Middleware

Added a middleware file to ensure proper routing and authentication checks.

### 7. Fixed TypeScript Type Errors

Resolved multiple TypeScript compilation errors in the Supabase client implementation:
- Created type-safe mock objects for the Supabase client
- Properly typed PostgrestFilterBuilder methods and return values
- Fixed realtime subscription methods with appropriate type assertions
- Enhanced error handling for all database operations

## How to Use the Debug Tools

1. When experiencing errors, navigate to `/debug` in your application
2. Click "Run Diagnostic Checks" to test all service connections
3. Review the results and follow the suggested fixes

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Missing Environment Variables

Ensure your `.env.local` file contains all required variables:

```bash
# Appwrite Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_URL=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=orderchha-app

# Supabase Configuration  
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://duzqqpcxatbdcxoevepy.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

### Connection Issues

1. **Appwrite**: Ensure your project ID is correct and the project is active in the Appwrite console
2. **Supabase**: Verify your project is active and the API keys are correct

## Next Steps

1. Regularly run the diagnostics page to catch issues early
2. Consider implementing comprehensive monitoring
3. Add additional error handling to critical application flows
