# OrderChha Migration to Supabase-Only Architecture

## Changes Made

We've simplified the OrderChha application to use only Supabase as its database backend, removing the hybrid database model that included Firebase fallback. Here's a summary of the changes:

1. **Removed Hybrid Context**:
   - The application now uses only the Supabase context provider (`app-context-supabase.tsx`)
   - Removed the hybrid context file (`app-context-hybrid.tsx`)

2. **Updated Root Layout**:
   - Changed the import in `/src/app/layout.tsx` to use the Supabase context provider

3. **Created Dedicated Debug Page**:
   - Created a new database debug page at `/debug/database`
   - Focused on displaying Supabase connection status

4. **Created Cleanup Script**:
   - Created `clean-firebase.sh` to remove all Firebase-related files and code
   - This script removes:
     - Firebase bridge files
     - Hybrid context file
     - Firebase test API
     - Hybrid database debug page
     - Firebase documentation

5. **Updated Documentation**:
   - Updated `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` to focus on Supabase connection issues
   - Updated `README.md` to reflect the new architecture

## Running the Application

1. Ensure your Supabase environment variables are set correctly:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
   ```

2. Make sure your Appwrite environment variables are set for authentication:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=your-appwrite-endpoint
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-appwrite-project-id
   ```

3. Start the application:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Test the database connection:
   - Visit `/debug/database` to check Supabase connection status
   - Visit `/api/test-supabase` to directly test the API connection

## Complete Cleanup

To complete the cleanup of Firebase-related code and fully migrate to a Supabase-only architecture, run:

```bash
./clean-firebase.sh
```

This script will remove all Firebase-related files and code from the project.
